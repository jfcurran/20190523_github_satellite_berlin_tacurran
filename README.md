**GitHub Satellite**  
Open source software (OSS) is a dynamic, inclusive, participatory system for turning ideas into new software products. And it works. While OSS has shaped the way companies consume software, the enterprise approach to production often still has its roots in hierarchies and secretive sauces. This talk explains how to embrace OSS processes in a company infrastructure. If you plan to hire any developers in the near future, create diverse teams based on contributions and knowledge, release modern software every minute, every hour, every day, connect with customers to design new features, jam on new technologies and ideas, and generally have a blast working in an "enterprise," then this talk will help you achieve your goals. The approach in called "Innersource." It is the combination of GitHub culture and open source software principles. And it also works.
